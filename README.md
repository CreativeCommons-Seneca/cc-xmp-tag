# Seneca College free software projects with Creative Commons

This repository is a kind of incubator for projects that faculty and staff at Seneca College work on in collaboration with Creative Commons.

Since these GitHub wiki pages are not indexable by search engines - we won't put too much documentation here. Instead there will be links to external websites.

## Projects currently in here:

### cc-xmp-tag

Various tools to easily read and write XMP metadata. Currently has two implementations (more may be created later):

* cc-xmp-tag.pl: perl program, useful on a Linux server.
* CCXMPTag: java library for Android or JavaSE to use in an Android or other Java application.
